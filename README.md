# my_MEC_program
I build this Mobile Edge Computation simulating environment all by myself, and use the costomized ddpg reinforcement learning algorithm to make offloading decision.
The DDPG reinforcement learning deccision algorithm was mostly from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yd5WnYls_Y, while some adjustments were made to fit the MEC environment.
